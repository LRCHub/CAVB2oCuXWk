Hey
Do you remember we said,
"Hello"?
And you asked me 'bout my Levi's
t-shirt
Said, "You are a friend of mine"
My, oh my
You must have saved me 'bout a
thousand times
I wouldn't be the one I am today
If you hadn't been a friend of
mine
I ain't misbehaving, I'm just
telling you the truth
Take my love for granted, yeah,
I'd give it all to you
Make me count for something,
yeah, I feel it in my heart
God only knows what I'd have
been if you hadn't been
A friend of mine
Hey
I haven't seen you 'round since
high school
How you doing, do you still
remember me?
Are you still a friend of mine?
Guess you're still a friend of
mine
Guess you're still a friend of
mine
Now I see
Why I get nervous when you look
at me
It's like your eyes are trying
to tell me something
That you're more than just a
friend of mine
That you're more than just a
friend of mine, oh my
I ain't misbehaving, I'm just
telling you the truth
Take my love for granted, yeah,
I'd give it all to you
Make me count for something,
yeah, I feel it in my heart
God only knows what I'd have
been if you hadn't been
A friend of mine
